# Customer-Shopping-Portal
Developed a software solution for managing an online shopping portal using PHP as the backend, HTML and Bootstrap for the front end, and MySQL as the database, following good database modeling and normalization practices

1. Customers can register and log in to access the shopping portal.
2. Users can browse the available product catalog and view product details (name, price,
date, etc.).
3. Customers can place orders for desired products, with each order and product
automatically recorded in the database.
4. The portal allows customers to view their order history, including product details,
amount, date, and order status.
5. All user actions and data management (login, ordering, product listing) are performed
dynamically through the web interface, ensuring data integrity and a smooth user
experience
